Description: Consider a goodness-of-fit (GOF) problem of 
            testing whether a random sample comes from one 
            sample location-scale model where location and
            scale parameters are unknown. It is well known 
            that Khmaladze martingale transformation method
            proposed by Khmaladze (1981) <doi:10.1137/1126027> 
            provides asymptotic distribution free test for the GOF problem.
            This package provides test statistic and critical 
            value of GOF test for normal, Cauchy, and logistic 
            distributions. This package used the main algorithm
            proposed by Kim (2020) <doi:10.1007/s00180-020-00971-7>
            and tests for other distributions will be available 
            at the later version.
